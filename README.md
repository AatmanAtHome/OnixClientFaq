No, you don't. All you get is #cool-chat .

- To enable mincraftia font open the gui then press module settings. On the right you should see mincraftia font enable that and you should be good.

### **Why is the rpc still not showing?**
You could be in the discord web or you could have disabled rpc showing on the desktop client.



### **Why is there are no DLLs in #download Just injectors/launchers?**
This is mostly because there is a bug with one of the modules that needs fixing and it will crash you lots. You can always find the dll on the github if you need it that badly: [download](https://github.com/bernarddesfosse/onixclientautoupdate/blob/main/OnixClient.dll?raw=true).



### **Why are the screenshots I take with onix black?**
- The screenshot function is broken. uwp apps have lost perms for ``app capture services`` so blame windows. Old versions of windows/minecraft might still support it though. I recommend clicking unbind/selecting a key you don't click much for the screenshot hotkey if it shows black for you, as it can be annoying.



### **Why don't the potion hud icons show?**
- Your pack is most likely removing them, download the hotfix pack in [#public-beta](https://discord.com/channels/814195071356370977/852516190109958144) and put it at the top of your pack list. Note this pack may break custom hotbars/xp bars.



### **Why does the onix launcher/injector give me a .net framework error when I open it?**
- Make sure both of these are installed: [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48) the ``runtime`` one & [vc_redist.x64.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe). then try to reopen it.



### **Why when I have render options on I can't see beds and chests and other blocks?**
- This is because you have ``hide tile entities`` turned on. Title entity (also known as block entity) is extra data associated with a block. On bedrock they are called blockActor but more people are familiar to how java calls them: TileEntity



### **Antivirus blocks the client**
- Depending on the anti-virus that you are using you may either turn it off so you can download the client or you can exclude it. To note, this client is not a virus of any sort.
