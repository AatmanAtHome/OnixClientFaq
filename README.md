### **Why is there no DLLs in #download Just injectors/launchers?**
This is mostly because there is a bug with one of the modules that needs fixing and it will crash you lots. You can always find the dll on the github if you need it that badly: [download](https://github.com/bernarddesfosse/onixclientautoupdate/blob/main/OnixClient.dll?raw=true).



### **Why are the screenshots I take with onix black?**
- The screenshot function is broken. uwp apps have lost perms for ``app capture services`` so blame windows. For your screenshots not to be black you need minecraft installed in debug mode (don't ask me how). I recommend clicking unbind/selecting a key you don't click much for the screenshot hotkey if it shows black for you, as it can be annoying.



### **Why don't the potion hud icons show?**
- Your pack is most likely removing them, download the hotfix pack [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852320290750726145/874753455418388550/PotionFix.mcpack) and put it at the top of your pack list. Note this pack may break custom hotbars/xp bars as it uses the same layer as them.



### **Why does the onix launcher/injector give me a .net framework error when I open it?**
- Make sure both of these are installed: [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48) the ``runtime`` one & [vc_redist.x64.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe). Then try to reopen it.



### **Why when I have render options on I can't see beds and chests and other blocks?**
- This is because you have ``hide tile entities`` turned on. Title entity (also known as block entity) is extra data associated with a block. On bedrock they are called blockActor but more people are familiar to how java calls them: TileEntity.



### **How do I change the theme of my onix gui?**
- Do ``.theme`` in chat. To share themes go to your onix client folder and there is a file called ``theme.txt``. To change theme with a premade theme have minecraft closed then delete the ``theme.txt`` from your folder then save the new one in the folder with the file name ``theme.txt`` and reopen minecraft and it should have loaded. At this time there is not a theme manager like the config one (.config) and there probably won't be because onix doesn't wanna make it.



### **How do I reset a color/module?**
-Middle click (by clicking the scroll wheel directly down) the change color button or the module in the onix gui.



### **Antivirus blocks the client**
